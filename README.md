  <summary>Background</summary>
  I started styding psychology in 2019 and I'm in love with it since. In 2020 due to lockdown I really didn't know if it could be possible to keep my instance in college, so I have nothing but to look for other alternatives to work from home or something reliable to study online.
  
  It was on late 2021 when I was going home, scrolling down on instagram that an advertise pop up on my phone about web development and decided to give it a try. It was love at first sight. I receive a scolarship from a friend to study on an educational online platform and push all my efforts to learn web development. It was hard though, but something within me makes me resonate deep on this kind of art, like every programmer were like a digital craftsman, and I wanted to be one too. 2022 was the year that I really took this thing about programming and IT in generally really serious. From there, I have dedicated my time on study web development and psychology at the same time, hoping one day being able to merge both passions into one fun and amazing creation.
